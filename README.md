# spatial

Spatial and temporal partitioning trees based on Uber's [H3 spatial index](https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/).  

Work-in-progress:
 - H3Tree - a space partitioning tree based on work done for Urbantz on timeslot optimization. [implemented]
 - H3T1Tree - a time-and-space partitioning tree useful for searches of geographical locations in given time intervals. 

## Getting started

Get the latest version of sbt from [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org) and run the tests:
